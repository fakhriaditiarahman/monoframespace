**Learning:** Found a specific anti-pattern in the codebase where developers used `motion.img` purely for Tailwind CSS hover effects (e.g., `group-hover:scale-100`). This completely bypassed Next.js built-in image optimization capabilities (`next/image`), missing out on automatic lazy loading, resolution scaling, and WebP/AVIF format selection.
**Action:** Always replace `<motion.img>` with Next.js `<Image>` when Framer Motion is not actively animating properties dynamically via React. Relying on standard CSS (Tailwind) for hover interactions on Next.js images provides the same visual result with significantly better performance.

**Learning:** High-frequency events like `mousemove` or `scroll` that trigger `gsap.to()` create a new tween object on every execution, causing layout thrashing and garbage collection overhead.
**Action:** Always use `gsap.quickTo()` instead of `gsap.to()` for rapid, continuous parameter updates. This creates a reusable, highly optimized setter function that dramatically improves performance.

## 2025-02-13 - [Throttle high-frequency scroll events]
**Learning:** High-frequency events like `scroll` that trigger state updates can cause layout thrashing. Note that `passive: true` has no effect on `scroll`, `mousemove`, or `mouseover` events for this purpose.
**Action:** When optimizing high-frequency `scroll` events that trigger state updates, use `requestAnimationFrame` to throttle the updates and prevent layout thrashing.

## 2025-02-14 - [Framer Motion Hooks in Loops & GC Overhead]
**Learning:** Found an anti-pattern where static text was dynamically split using `.split(" ")` during every render frame inside a high-frequency `scroll` component. Furthermore, `useTransform` was called inline within the resulting `.map()` array, severely violating React's Rules of Hooks and causing excessive garbage collection (GC) overhead during rapid scroll events.
**Action:** Always extract static configurations (like string splits or arrays) outside the component body. In Framer Motion, if you need to map over elements and apply a `useTransform` per item, always extract the mapped body into a separate child component (e.g., `<NarrativeWord>`) to encapsulate the hook properly and guarantee hook order stability.

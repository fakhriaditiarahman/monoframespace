**Learning:** Found a specific anti-pattern in the codebase where developers used `motion.img` purely for Tailwind CSS hover effects (e.g., `group-hover:scale-100`). This completely bypassed Next.js built-in image optimization capabilities (`next/image`), missing out on automatic lazy loading, resolution scaling, and WebP/AVIF format selection.
**Action:** Always replace `<motion.img>` with Next.js `<Image>` when Framer Motion is not actively animating properties dynamically via React. Relying on standard CSS (Tailwind) for hover interactions on Next.js images provides the same visual result with significantly better performance.

## 2025-02-12 - [gsap.to() inside mousemove events]
**Learning:** High-frequency events like `mousemove` or `scroll` that trigger `gsap.to()` create a new tween object on every execution, causing layout thrashing and garbage collection overhead.
**Action:** Always use `gsap.quickTo()` instead of `gsap.to()` for rapid, continuous parameter updates. This creates a reusable, highly optimized setter function that dramatically improves performance.

## 2025-02-13 - [Throttle high-frequency scroll events]
**Learning:** High-frequency events like `scroll` that trigger state updates can cause layout thrashing. Note that `passive: true` has no effect on `scroll`, `mousemove`, or `mouseover` events for this purpose.
**Action:** When optimizing high-frequency `scroll` events that trigger state updates, use `requestAnimationFrame` to throttle the updates and prevent layout thrashing.

## 2025-02-13 - [useTransform inside array map]
**Learning:** Found a critical anti-pattern where Framer Motion's `useTransform` hook was being called directly inside an array `.map()` in `NarrativeScene`. This violates React's Rules of Hooks because the number of hooks called on each render could theoretically change, and it causes hook order instability which degrades React's reconciliation performance.
**Action:** When mapping over items that require individual Framer Motion hook calls (like `useTransform`), always extract the loop item into a separate functional component (e.g., `NarrativeWord`) and pass down the necessary values (index, total length, parent scroll progress). This ensures hook calls remain stable at the component level.

**Learning:** Found a specific anti-pattern in the codebase where developers used `motion.img` purely for Tailwind CSS hover effects (e.g., `group-hover:scale-100`). This completely bypassed Next.js built-in image optimization capabilities (`next/image`), missing out on automatic lazy loading, resolution scaling, and WebP/AVIF format selection.
**Action:** Always replace `<motion.img>` with Next.js `<Image>` when Framer Motion is not actively animating properties dynamically via React. Relying on standard CSS (Tailwind) for hover interactions on Next.js images provides the same visual result with significantly better performance.

## 2025-02-12 - [gsap.to() inside mousemove events]
**Learning:** High-frequency events like `mousemove` or `scroll` that trigger `gsap.to()` create a new tween object on every execution, causing layout thrashing and garbage collection overhead.
**Action:** Always use `gsap.quickTo()` instead of `gsap.to()` for rapid, continuous parameter updates. This creates a reusable, highly optimized setter function that dramatically improves performance.

## 2025-02-13 - [Throttle high-frequency scroll events]
**Learning:** High-frequency events like `scroll` that trigger state updates can cause layout thrashing. Note that `passive: true` has no effect on `scroll`, `mousemove`, or `mouseover` events for this purpose.
**Action:** When optimizing high-frequency `scroll` events that trigger state updates, use `requestAnimationFrame` to throttle the updates and prevent layout thrashing.

## 2024-04-24 - [useTransform inside array .map() loop]
**Learning:** Calling Framer Motion hooks like `useTransform` inside an array `.map()` loop (e.g., in a high-frequency scroll component like `NarrativeScene`) violates React's Rules of Hooks. This can cause hook order instability, memory leaks, and re-render bugs.
**Action:** Always extract the body of a `.map()` loop into a separate functional component (e.g., `NarrativeWord`) if it requires using hooks like `useTransform`. This guarantees that hooks are called at the top level of the component and maintains stability.

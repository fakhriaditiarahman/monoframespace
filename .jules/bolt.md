**Learning:** Found a specific anti-pattern in the codebase where developers used `motion.img` purely for Tailwind CSS hover effects (e.g., `group-hover:scale-100`). This completely bypassed Next.js built-in image optimization capabilities (`next/image`), missing out on automatic lazy loading, resolution scaling, and WebP/AVIF format selection.
**Action:** Always replace `<motion.img>` with Next.js `<Image>` when Framer Motion is not actively animating properties dynamically via React. Relying on standard CSS (Tailwind) for hover interactions on Next.js images provides the same visual result with significantly better performance.

## 2025-02-12 - [gsap.to() inside mousemove events]
**Learning:** High-frequency events like `mousemove` or `scroll` that trigger `gsap.to()` create a new tween object on every execution, causing layout thrashing and garbage collection overhead.
**Action:** Always use `gsap.quickTo()` instead of `gsap.to()` for rapid, continuous parameter updates. This creates a reusable, highly optimized setter function that dramatically improves performance.

## 2025-02-13 - [Throttle high-frequency scroll events]
**Learning:** High-frequency events like `scroll` that trigger state updates can cause layout thrashing. Note that `passive: true` has no effect on `scroll`, `mousemove`, or `mouseover` events for this purpose.
**Action:** When optimizing high-frequency `scroll` events that trigger state updates, use `requestAnimationFrame` to throttle the updates and prevent layout thrashing.

## 2025-02-13 - [Extract static arrays and avoid hooks in loops]
**Learning:** Found an anti-pattern where a static string was being split (`text.split(' ')`) on every render of a scroll-driven component (`NarrativeScene`). Additionally, Framer Motion's `useTransform` hook was being called inside the `.map()` callback, violating React's Rules of Hooks (hook order must remain stable).
**Action:** Always move static data and operations (like string splitting or array creation) outside of the functional component to prevent redundant execution and garbage collection overhead during frequent re-renders. Always extract loop items that require hooks into separate child components to ensure stable hook ordering and compliance with React's Rules of Hooks.

**Learning:** Found a specific anti-pattern in the codebase where developers used `motion.img` purely for Tailwind CSS hover effects (e.g., `group-hover:scale-100`). This completely bypassed Next.js built-in image optimization capabilities (`next/image`), missing out on automatic lazy loading, resolution scaling, and WebP/AVIF format selection.
**Action:** Always replace `<motion.img>` with Next.js `<Image>` when Framer Motion is not actively animating properties dynamically via React. Relying on standard CSS (Tailwind) for hover interactions on Next.js images provides the same visual result with significantly better performance.

## 2025-02-12 - [gsap.to() inside mousemove events]
**Learning:** High-frequency events like `mousemove` or `scroll` that trigger `gsap.to()` create a new tween object on every execution, causing layout thrashing and garbage collection overhead.
**Action:** Always use `gsap.quickTo()` instead of `gsap.to()` for rapid, continuous parameter updates. This creates a reusable, highly optimized setter function that dramatically improves performance.

## 2025-02-13 - [Throttle high-frequency scroll events]
**Learning:** High-frequency events like `scroll` that trigger state updates can cause layout thrashing. Note that `passive: true` has no effect on `scroll`, `mousemove`, or `mouseover` events for this purpose.
**Action:** When optimizing high-frequency `scroll` events that trigger state updates, use `requestAnimationFrame` to throttle the updates and prevent layout thrashing.

## 2026-04-11 - [Rules of Hooks violations with Framer Motion]
**Learning:** Found instances where Framer Motion hooks like `useTransform` were called directly inline within JSX props (e.g., `style={{ opacity: useTransform(...) }}`) and inside array `.map()` loops. This violates React's Rules of Hooks by creating dynamic hook calls that can change order or quantity between renders, potentially leading to memory leaks or re-render bugs.
**Action:** Always extract inline hook calls to the top level of the functional component. For loop bodies requiring hooks, extract them into a separate functional component (e.g., `<AnimatedWord>`) to guarantee hook order stability and ensure compliance with the Rules of Hooks.
